        The story We set out to create the adventures we wanted to experience.
We set out to create the opportunity for the world to join us.
â€‹After a few years of studying, two childhood friends came together to implement the ideas 
that were born during their younger years. Gathering all the knowledge and tools.
In 2013 they founded the company Living Archipelago and since that day they have been building a base to stand on and 
opening up the possibility for people around the world to enjoy the archipelago. With the total respect for how things 
have always been in the archipelago combined with an interest in the modern ways of living they now carry all the tools needed for these adventures. Equipment for all activities, 
handmade timber cottages to accommodate all guests and a chef in their own restaurant kitchen preparing all the meals.
